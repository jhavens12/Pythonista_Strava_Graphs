# Pythonista_Strava_graphs
Written for Pythonista, shows a gui of solo vs partner runs for various times

Also includes graphs on bottom which show running totals for different days
Graphs refresh when you hit week/month/2017

Originally named RunStatsv11

Requires credentials.py file which includes the api_key variable from Strava

This is an older version and has not been updated since 7.26.17
calc.py includes a lot of unnecessary code
get_data.py is the old version - extremely cumbersome compared to my newer projects
